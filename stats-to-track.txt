Considering that the board from the game is quite massive, and there a lot of logic still yet to program, lets start over on the map generation.

Lets have 5 rows and 9 columns.
Lets have 1 city at each corner, and 1 city in the middle of the top row and the bottom row.

I saw a youtube developer suggest using pygame, not sure if that would be easier/better to use than tk?
